      Funny story about stereotypes. Once at an old job of mine in the doing online marketing at a very large company I received an email from the HR department. I got a little bit scared and wondered what I could have done wrong. It wasn't actually anything like that at all. They were taking some pictures of employees that would get included on the recruitment website and in some brochures that would be handed out at job fair and events like that and someone had mentioned me so there were just reaching out to see if that would be something I was cool with. I had no problem with it and set up an appointment for the photo-shoot. The pictures were taken a few days later and then I didn't hear anything about it for a while.

      About a month later I got a text from a friend saying that they saw me on the company website and I should totally check it out. "It's actually kind of hilarious," he said. I went to the website and immediately saw what he found so funny.

      There was a (pretty great) picture of me on the careers website under the heading of IT Professional. I want to re-iterate here that I worked in marketing. I am pretty good with computers, but not IT Professional good. I wish I was IT Professional good because those guys got paid the big bucks. I didn't really make a big deal out of it but inside I definitely felt a little twinge of "Well I guess that's all a brown guy can ever be."

      The problem with stereotypes isn't just restricted to how people view others. A large part, and I would argue, the more insidious threat that stereotypes pose is how it affects how we view ourselves. The horrible, self-fulfilling thing about stereotypes is that knowing the stereotypes about the different groups we identify with can lead to us actually fulfilling those stereotypes. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">sterotype threat</a> and is an idea first put forth by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in a study published in 1995. They talk about the cycle created where negative stereotypes cause people to perform in ways that confirm them and thus reinforce the stereotypes. Their studies also showed a way to combat this stereotype threat. This was to de-emphasize the affects that our identities have on performance. When women were told that their gender had no impact on their performance on a certain test they did just as well, if not better, than their male counterparts. Same with African-Americans on a similar experiment.

      As a final, short, aside I would like to talk about the threat from a different type of stereotype. That is the danger of "positive stereotypes". I put that in quotes because I feel that there really is no such thing. Asians are good at math. Indians are good at computers. These might seem innocuous or even complimentary but they really hurt someone from those groups that actually do well in those fields. It is very easy to dismiss an Indian person excelling in IT or an Asian mathematician with an eye-roll and a "Well of-course she's good at that". We let our expectations of an identity color how we react to people doing something well. I am not saying this is some sort of cure-all but to be conscious of the fact that a person's actions and performance, both positive and negative, are their own and not indicative of anything about their identity.
