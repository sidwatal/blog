  <h1>Is Feedback Always Necessary?</h1>
  <h2>Feedback-ception: It's feedback all the way down.</h2>

      Feedback is important. That much is a given. Feedback is natural and feedback is necessary for growth. Nobody disputes this. The problem comes in when we are required to give feedback on almost every interaction we have with someone in our cohort. I feel like this lessens the impact of our feedback and cheapens it.

      I can't tell you how often I've left feedback and written the first part commenting on how we attacked the problem and then just stared at the box with nothing actionable to say. Not every interaction needs some sort of constructive criticism. Sometimes you and a person mesh well and there is nothing you would change. Forcing us to give something actionable in this situation will only produce something, at best, useless, and at worst, actually harmful.

      A lot of the interactions we have at Dev Bootcamp are contrived reflections of interactions and relationships we will see as developers. The mandatory pairing assignment this week(week 5) is a prime example. We have to learn and get comfortable with pair programming but this was just not the assignment to do this. Reading and refactoring code, at least for me, is a silent, solitary task involving lots or reading and scanning. Forcing us to verbalize as we read and tell the other person to type was just confusing, irritating, and frustrating. The feedback portion of phase 0 also feels like it's contrived. We have to get comfortable giving and receiving feedback. But I don't feel forcing people to give this sort of feedback is counter-productive.
