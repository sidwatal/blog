      If you have been following the news you might have heard abut a major story coming out of Washington, D.C.. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/technology/path-clears-for-net-neutrality-ahead-of-fcc-vote.html">Republicans in Congress have conceded to the Obama administration on Net Neutrality</a>. You should have just jumped out of your seat and cheered. This is huge, not just for the tech community, but also for the public in general.

      The concept of net neutrality is actually a very basic one. If you want to look at how it functions just take a look at the Internet right now. That's right. For all intents and purposes, the Internet is currently neutral. This means that the structure of the net is content agnostic. The wires connecting your modem to all the sites out there don't care about the content that is traveling over them. They just deliver the content. Well cable companies, ISPs, and other telecom giants want to change all that. They want to create a tiered system where content will be treated differently and some content will be delivered faster than others. If you hear the cable companies tell it, they won't be slowing any content down. They will just be speeding some content up. Well that would still create a tiered system where any company that can afford to pay will have a huge advantage over companies that cant. Still doesn't feel like it's a big deal. Well Senator Al Franken from Minnesota has called Net Neutrality <a href="http://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=news&id=1831">"the first amendment issue of our time"</a>.

      Listen to the eloquent John Oliver explain the concept better than I ever can.

      For now it seems like the Obama administration and Congress are doing the right thing and protecting the Internet as we know it. But this is definitely something we as a country, and especially us in the tech industry, need to keep an eye on. Use the power of the vote and the ability to contact your reps. Make sure you know where your reps stand. Protect the net and you don't let cable companies take advantage of us to make a profit.
