  <h2>How Affirming the Things You Find Important Helps You Battle Stereotype Threat</h2>

      In last week's cultural blog I spoke about stereotypes and how they can be self fulfilling. You can see my thoughts on <a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Stereotype Threat</a> here. As a refresher, stereotype threat is a situation where the fear of confirming a stereotype about a group we identify with causes us to act in a way we normally wouldn't, sometimes in a way that confirms the stereotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way that researchers have found to battle stereotype threat is through self affirmation. If we just think about ourselves and the values that we hold up as important we stop thinking of ourselves in terms of the stereotypes that people may or may not have about us.
    </p>

      One thing I hold up above all others is activism. It is extremely important to me. I would rather be around people that are passionate enough about something enough to fight for it than be around people that agree with me on topic I am passionate about. This to me is the ultimate test of your strength as a person. I have marched, protested, picketed etc. and have met some of the most important people in my life doing this. It is not something I generally give advice on, mostly because I am not the type of person that values another's experience. That came off a bit more negatively than it was meant. I just mean that I find that I need to make the mistakes before I can learn from them, so giving someone else advice would be hypocritical. That being said, I am always down for a lovely debate on the subject. I love talking about things that are important to me and hopefully affect people in ways that make them act on things they are passionate about.

      I guess by acting out on my activist ways I am acting out one of my stereotypes. That of the North-Eastern, over-sensitive, politically correct, liberal. But in the words of comedian Hari Kondabolu "Telling me that I'm obsessed with talking about racism in America is like telling me I'm obsessed with swimming when I'm drowning." I think if we are passionate about things and act out on those passions then stereotype threat isn't any threat at all. I guess I'm just lucky that the things I'm passionate about are things like race, colonialism, and cultural appropriations. This keeps things like stereotypes and other forms of subtle racism at the forefront of my mind. Also on the flip side I hope that if I trip up say something offensive without meaning to I am called out on it.
