      Going through our prep-work for Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp we were asked to analyze the way we work and learn. One of these self assessments was the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>
      </a> test. The results of my test showed a definite bias towards a Random Ordering ability but I am completely tied between a Concrete and Abstract Perceptual quality. Looking through the qualities of Concrete Random and Abstract Random thinkers shows some qualities that I definitely recognize in myself but also shows some conflicts that I have to work hard in order to reconcile.

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      As you can see there are a lot of similarities between the two styles. Both don't handle formality well and have trouble guiding people through the fine details of their work. They seem to be big picture people. What I am having trouble reconciling is the fact that Concrete Random thinkers seem to thrive in competition while Abstract Random thinkers find competition really hard. Just knowing myself I am pretty sure that I probably fall more on the Concrete Random side because I know that I am not competitive. It just isn't in me to try to <em>beat</em> someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think a part of my aversion to competition has to do with how I deal with failure and feedback. Hyper-competitive people want to succeed at all costs. There is nothing wrong with this but these type of people take failure personally. This has to do with the difference between a fixed and growth mindset. Fixed intelligence people feel that your intellect is set in stone and you should only do things you are good at. Growth intelligence tells us that you can become good at anything if you work hard at it, even things you feel you don't have an aptitude for.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fixed intelligence person needs to always be successful because failure makes them lose their sense of being smart or skilled. A growth mindset person sees a failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed and growth mindset people also see feedback differently. Fixed intelligence people only like hearing feedback about their existing abilities because that is all they think they can ever be good at. They are also not interested in feedback on answers they have already gotten wrong. Growth mindset people thrive on feedback. It is their only gauge to know what things they need to get better.
