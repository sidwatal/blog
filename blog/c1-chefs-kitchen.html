The main thing I took away from <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> is the problem with the transactional view of education. I come from a family that values education above all else. This sounds like a positive but it is something that I have come to resent. Education is important, but not when it comes at the cost of actual knowledge. In my family all that is important is the degree you got, where you got it from, and what you are doing with it. "You invested $X into your education. What is your ROI?" This a great model for your life if that is what you are into. A lot of my friends are living highly successful and fulfilling lives with this model. The problem is when you start thinking of education as a zero sum game. Too many times in this transactional model people think that the only way to get ahead is to make sure nobody else does. Sometimes people ask "Well what is the point of knowledge then?" And to those people I answer "Sometimes the knowledge is the point."

        In my mind the Alan Watts video is a perfect compliment to Shereef's chat. Nobody will argue that being driven and goal-oriented is somehow a bad thing. But to be those things and ignore the journey to get there is, in my opinion, extremely harmful. I think education is best when it is collaborative. I find that the best way I learn something I am unsure about it to teach it to someone. When we are all out to help each other learn is when we learn the most. It helps us improve both on the technical and personal side. The few interactions I have had with the DBC staff and my cohort up to this point have just been amazing from this point of view. People have been kind and helpful on all sides. I know I am not living in a utopia and a system like this only works if everyone is doing their fair share, but what I have seen till now has given me nothing but hope for the best.
