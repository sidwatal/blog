  <h2>Why Avoidance is Not the Answer</h2>

      Conflict comes up all the time. Death, taxes, and conflict. It is the pivot around which all literature is written, all movies are made, and games are plated. Conflict is what drives everything forward. It can be big like the Civil Rights movement, or tiny like someone took your favorite parking spot on the street in front of your house. In all the years I have been alive I have figured out the best way to handle conflict and it has worked for me time and time again.

      AVOIDANCE ...
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>NOT</strong></em>
    </p>

      I'll admit it. I am an avoider extrodinaire. There has never been a friendship, relationship, random encounter, or job where I haven't gone out of my way to avoid conflict. This is really helpful in the short term. This also builds up toxicity in relationships and causes them to not last very long. This TED Talk by mathematician Hannah Fry is great but I want you to pay extra close attention to her Top Tip #3(12:10 mark).

      As you can see, psychologists have come to the kind of counter-intuitive conclusion that the best couples are the ones that don't let anything go and argue about trivial things. They measured something called a negativity threshold. This is the threshold of how annoying or negative something makes us feel before we make an issue out of it. One might think that the most successful couples are ones with a very high negativity threshold. These would be couples that never fight and give each other a lot of leeway in the way they act. Things need to be really bad before they bring it up (this is me). Couples with a low negativity threshold bring up any small thing that annoys them and have open discussions on anything that is bothering them. They have a sort of safe space where anything and everything is talked about openly(this is not me).

      In what I have read and seen about DBC it seems like a place where people are encouraged to have a low negativity threshold. This does not mean that every tiny thing is turned into a big deal. But it does mean that things are talked about in an open and frank manner before they are allowed to build up into things that can have an actual negative impact on any one person. It is the kind of environment where I will be extremely uncomfortable, I am sure. But also the exact thing I need to really grow as a person.
