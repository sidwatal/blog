  <h1>Git, Version Control and Marty McFly</h1>
  <h4>Feb 3, 2015</h4>

<img src="assets/Back_to_the_Future.jpg"> The best way I can describe Git to someone is that it is a time machine for your code. You can use it to go back to almost any point in the history of your code and fix things. It's like in Back to the Future 2 when due to Marty's mistakes in 2015 (woah, where's my hoverboard?) Biff was able to travel back to 1955 and alter the timeline so that 1985 was all messed up. Speaking in terms of Git, what Marty needed to do was revert back to the 1955 commit of the Hill Valley repo. Biff's edits to the repo had caused the entire program to crash so Marty needed to fix all those changes. Once he had taken back the sports almanac from Biff and had made sure that the rest of the code was unaffected, he pushed his edits to the master branch in Hill_Valley.git and headed back to his time. I'm going to stop now before I over-extend the metaphor too much.

      While it's clear that Git is an indispensable tool for developers, GitHub is where software development and the open source community really shines. I am repeatedly shocked at how much developers give of themselves in order to sustain the open source ecosystem. What really blows me away are the people and organizations using GitHub for purposes beyond just software development. People use it to <a href="https://github.com/rayber/wedding">collaboratively create wedding invitations</a>. It can be used for <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">version control while writing a book</a>. Finally and, in my opinion, most amazingly, the White House has open sourced their entire budget by <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">releasing all the data behind it on GitHub</a>. The ethos behind open source is one of complete transparency. It is both scary and oddly comforting.

      GitHub is also a huge asset to a newbie coder like me. It is like a massive peer-reviewed journal. The popular repositories have been pored over by experts in the field and I know no matter what I am learning there will be examples of it on there. Not just examples of perfectly working code, but also examples of works in progress. Examples with the same mistakes that I am sure to make as I slowly learn coding. Examples where those same mistakes have then been fixed. I have gone into the issues pages of some large repositories, and while 99% of the things being talked about in the discussions are over my head, I can at least get faint glimmers of understanding about things like communication culture. I know these skills are just as important as the actual coding that we will be doing
