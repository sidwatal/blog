      The further we get into enumerable methods the more I wish I had paid closer attention to the RubyDocs during my first pass through them. The group_by method would have been extremely helpful to me last week and earlier this week. It would have saved me a lot of grief and headaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's first talk a little bit about what the group_by method does. In simplest terms, the methods takes an input like an array, passes all the elements of the input through a code block and outputs a hash where the keys are the outputs of the code block and the values are all the elements that outputted that key. If that is a little confusing look at this code example below.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
      #Separate all even and odd numbers in an array. <br />
      arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] <br />
      arr.group_by { |i| i % 2} <br />
      ---------- <br />
      {0=>[2,4,6,8,10], 1=>[1,3,5,7,9]}
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can immediately see how helpful this can be. The code block the method passes can be anything. You can use methods like include? or class to group elements in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of passing an array to the group_by method we do some pretty cool stuff by passing a hash. We can take a hash which has a lot of repeating values and group them all by those values. In the following example I will take a hash with all my friends and their relation statuses. Then I will output a hash where we are all grouped by those statuses.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
      hash = {"Sid" => "single","Febin" => "married", "Shankar" => "single", "Krishna" =>"single","Rishi" =>"married", "Jay" => "relationship", "Mathew" => "relationship", "Sumeet" => "married"}<br />
      hash.group_by {|person,status| status}<br />
      ----------<br />
      {"single"=>[["Sid", "single"], ["Shankar", "single"], ["Krishna", "single"]], "married"=>[["Febin", "married"], ["Rishi", "married"], ["Sumeet", "married"]], "relationship"=>[["Jay", "relationship"], ["Mathew", "relationship"]]}
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As you can see the method outputs a hash of arrays that are grouped by the values in the input array.
