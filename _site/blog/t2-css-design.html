      I'll be honest with you. I really like working with CSS. I am really bad at working with CSS. It is just not something I have been able to get on an intuitive level. CSS positioning is really hard for me. I'm pretty sure that a career as a front end developer isn't in the cards for me. That being said, I should know at least the basics of CSS.

      I was able to use some of the tricks I learned this week to hack together a pretty ugly version of my site index. I was very unhappy with the way my site looked and how it displayed on browsers of different sized windows. Some of my divs were positioned under other divs. My fonts were ugly. The list goes on. But my main gripe was the way the different divs on my page were organized. So unhappy, in fact, that I decided to scrap the entire thing and start from scratch.

      This time I wanted to do things using a different process because the first time obviously didn't work. Instead of filling out every thing in the HTML first and then working on positioning, I did the opposite. Created my divs with one line of placeholder text then worked on positioning them correctly before filling them with content. I gave all the divs different colors and gave them thick borders so that their positioning was very obvious. I found this to be extremely helpful with positioning.

      This image was extremely helpful to me in conceptualizing the relationship between margin, padding, and border. I still sometimes get them confused but if you think of them like a shipping container it helps. The content is the thing you are trying to ship. The padding is the bubble wrap. The border is the box you are shipping in. And finally the margin is that distance between your box and other boxes on the delivery truck. Now, if only positioning was that easy.
