      Pair programming is a system where two programmers share one document, via screensharing or being at the same computer, and code a piece of software together. The system involves one person being the driver and one being the navigator. The driver types out the code and deals with the minutia of coding and the navigator worries more about the big picture.

      Pair programming is important to DBC and the learning process in general because as a beginner it is great to have someone checking for errors as you are doing the coding. Editing and debugging can happen after a person is done but to have it in real-time can be a huge advantage for a beginner programmer. Also, by pairing with people at the same level as us we can learn together.

  For this challenge I really tried to work on my CSS positioning. It still is something that I am not too comfortable with. During the GPS I just couldn't figure out how to make sure my image stays in the div. If the window was too big the image was sticking out and it looked ugly. I made a hacky fix by making the image smaller but it still stuck out if the window was too big.

  After the GPS though, I continued to research how to fix it and stumbled onto a great solution. I found out about the overflow attribute in CSS. But adding "overflow: auto" to my content div I was able to set my div to always be bigger than the image and text.
